# Tofurkey
Tofurkey is a synth that’s all script! There are no samples. SFZ format only.

🎹	Five separate oscillators, each of which has its own independent controls:

•	Volume, Generator, Pitch Bend, Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release, Lowpass, and Pan
•	Controls arranged in per-oscillator columns for easy tracking.
•	Eight harmonic settings available for Sine, four each for Triangle, Sawtooth, and Square.
°	16', 8’, 5¹⁄₃', 4' for all generators listed, plus 3¹⁄₅', 2²⁄₃', 2²⁄₇', 2' Sine.
°	Both the waveform and the frequency multiple are controlled simultaneously (there’s a chart).
•	Any oscillator can be used as a Noise channel.
•	The LPF cutoff scales with the key played, combined with the selected Lowpass value.
•	Panning hard L or R allows crossfading out or in by velocity (beyond what velocity normally does).
🎹	Controls act in real time, except:
•	Generator cannot change notes already sounding.
•	Enabling or disabling a crossfade mode cannot change notes already sounding.
🎹	Internally documented (read the .sfz file).
🎹	Includes .ariax presets, although you have to (mass-)edit the path inside them before they will load.
🎷	Keyboard optimized. Breath controller optimized version also included (“Tofurkey Breath”).

The name derives from the fact that when you look closely, there is no meat to be found – only vegetable matter being spiced up and passed off as meat.
